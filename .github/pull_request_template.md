## GitHub Issues
<!-- 
If this PR was motivated by some existing issues, reference them here.

If it is a simple bug-fix, please also add a line like 'Closes #123'
to your commit message, so that it is automatically closed.
If it is not, don't, as it might take several iterations for a feature
to be done properly. If in doubt, leave it open and reference it in the
PR itself, so that maintainers can decide.
