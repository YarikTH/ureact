Contributing to µReact
======================

By submitting a pull request or a patch, you represent that you have the right
to license your contribution to the µReact project owners and the community,
agree that your contributions are licensed under the µReact license, and agree
to future changes to the licensing.

Code should be formatted with a recent-enough ```clang-format``` using the config
file in the root of the repo (use `make pretty` to do so)

Thanks for contributing!
