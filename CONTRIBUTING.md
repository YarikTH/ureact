# Contributing to µReact

By submitting a pull request or a patch, you represent that you have the right
to license your contribution to the µReact project owners and the community,
agree that your contributions are licensed under the µReact license, and agree
to future changes to the licensing.

All pull requests should be made against the ```dev``` branch because the ```main```
is the stable one with the latest release.

Code should be formatted with a recent-enough ```clang-format``` using the config
file in the root of the repo (use `make pretty` to do so)

Thanks for contributing!
