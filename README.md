## Used third-party tools

The library itself consists of a single header file licensed under the MIT license. However, it is built, tested, documented, and whatnot using a lot of third-party tools and services. Thanks a lot!

- [**CMake**](https://cmake.org) for build automation
- [**ClangFormat**](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) for automatic source code indentation
- [**gersemi**](https://github.com/blankspruce/gersemi) for automatic CMake code indentation
- [**doctest**](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest) for the unit tests
