# CMake integration using ExternalProject

You can automatically fetch the entire **µReact** repository from GitHub and configure
it as [ExternalProject](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/ExternalProject.html).
As a result, we get the path to **µReact** include directory.

Then we can set up a proper CMake interface target `ureact::ureact` as we did
[here](../cmake_copied_header/).

Alternatively, you can go an easy way and add received include directory to your
target using `target_include_directories`.

Don't forget to `link` ExternalProject's target to your library or add it as a
dependency using `add_dependencies`.

## Running test

To run the test you should use a common CMake pattern:

```console
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
./cmake_test && echo SUCCESS || echo FAIL
```
