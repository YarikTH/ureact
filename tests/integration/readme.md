# Integration

The latest released version of **µReact** can be obtained from here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YarikTH/ureact/main/include/ureact/ureact.hpp

You can substitute ```main``` with ```dev``` or a tag like ```0.1.0``` for a specific version in the URL above.

You need to add

```cpp
#include <ureact/ureact.hpp>
```

to the files you want to process use µReact and set the necessary switches to enable C++17 (e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC and Clang).

See code example used for integration tests [here](../../support/integration_generation/test.cpp).

## CMake

There are plenty of ways to integrate **µReact** into the CMake project:

* [Using add_subdirectory](cmake_subdirectory/) - if you copy the whole repo of **µReact** or add it as a git submodule
* [Using find_package](cmake_find_package/) - if you have installed version of **µReact** find_package is a proper way to do
* [Using ExternalProject](cmake_external_project/) - good old way to acquire **µReact** from GitHub repo
* [Using FetchContent](cmake_fetch_content/) - modern way to acquire **µReact** from GitHub repo (CMake 3.11 is required)

All described CMake integration ways are accompanied by working examples that
are continuously tested on the CI server. You can run the test locally, using
the `integration_check` target of the root [Makefile](../../Makefile).

```console
make integration_check
```

📝 The ```CMakeLists.txt``` file of the **µReact** repository has ```install()```
commands, so you could use **µReact** as a package.
[find_package](cmake_find_package/readme.md#install-ureact-locally) example also
contains instructions for it.

## Package Managers

😅 Unfortunately, there are no package managers supported at this moment.
